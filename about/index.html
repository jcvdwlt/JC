<h1> About </h1>

<p> Hi, I'm JC. </p>

<p> I like reading, thinking, writing, jiu-jitsu, and maths. </p>

<p> I work as a Data Scientist at iwoca, where we're aiming to boost the economy by funding 1 million small businesses. I occasionally do contract work.</p>

<p> I'm a generalist, and I've worked on various things related to data and decision making.  I've worked on predictive modelling, A/B test design and analysis, 
  contrianed optimisation, multi-objective optimisation, etc.  I've developed full-stack solutions on top of some of these.   </p>
