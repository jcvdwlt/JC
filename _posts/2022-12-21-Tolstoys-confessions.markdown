Faith without purpose or meaning fades away. 

Conventional vices are celebrated.  Unique virtues are condemned. 

The belief in undefined “progress” has no substance.  The duties of everyday life obscure our confusion about ultimate motivations. 

Life contains suffering and death.  Reason alone cannot grant a finite life ultimate meaning. 

The question of life: What will come of what I do today or tomorrow? Progress in the infinite means nothing.  

Empiricism can say nothing about first causes.  

Abstract philosophy or metaphysics can only restate the question of life. 

Reason cannot answer life’s question, and suffering and death exists, therefore life is evil and should end. 

Reason is the fruit of life, yet reason rejects life? 

Those that live with meaning do so because of faith, which is irrational knowledge (revelation). 

Reason cannot relate the finite to the infinite.  Religious faith relates the finite to the infinite, human life to God. 

Infinite meaning cannot be destroyed (by suffering or death). 

Reason rejects life.  To enthrone reason above religion is to end life. 

Only faith that is acted out is real. 

Meaning comes from living by faith - the imitation of Christ.  Philosophizing leads to nothing. 

Live in search of God, and there will be no life without God.  This is the light.
