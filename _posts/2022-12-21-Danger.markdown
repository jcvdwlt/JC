Perception is the truth that matters.  It shapes life.

Perception is a mix of objective reality and interpretation through subjective narratives. 

Perception is not unanimous, since there are many possible narratives.

The powerful shape perception to serve their needs, and this corrupts over time.  Much of the power of the powerful may be legitimate, and power isn’t bad in and of itself, but some corruption inevitably accompanies powerful groups that are sustained over time.

Popular opinion is therefore heavily influenced by the aims of the powerful.  These aims don’t always serve the individual.

Independent thought, seeking narratives close to objective truth and useful to the individual, therefore leads to unpopular ideas. 

Holding and acting on unpopular correct ideas leads to increasing influence and power. 

Unpopular views and increasing power lead to conflict with those that are both powerful and served by existing popular opinion. 

Conflict with powerful enemies is dangerous. 

Progress, or even conservation, requires updating incorrect ideas.  That only happens when individuals think and act to do so.

Therefore it is important to be dangerous.
