<h1>Hi, I'm JC</h1>

<a href="https://jcvdwlt.github.io/JC/about">About</a>

<p>I like reading, thinking, writing, jiu-jitsu, and maths.</p>

<p>I work as a Data Scientist at iwoca, where we're aiming to boost the economy by funding 1 million small businesses. </p>

<p> I occasionally do contract work.  For example, I helped build market allocation tools for the largest vegatable 
<br> producer in South Africa, using mixed integer programming.  I've also advised on split-test design & analysis, using 
<br> hirarchical Bayesian models to help companies answer questions like "Should we run a test?", "Which test?", "How long for?" 
<br> "What if we see a massive difference early on?", "Can we peek at the data early on?", "What's the probability that this one is better?",
<br> and so on. </p>
