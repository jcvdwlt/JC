<h1> Some thoughts on investing </h1>
<p> These are some ideas (none are original) about investing, which I'd like to think about and elaborate on in the future. </p>

<h2> Margin of safety </h2>
<p> Benjamin Graham, the father of value investing, coined the term <em> margin of safety </em>, to encaptulate his investment decision makeing approach.  
Paraphrasing, it states that you should only buy a security when it's avialable at prices that represent a significant discount from a conservative estimate 
of its intrinsic value.  There is a lot to unpack there. 
</p>

<p> When can you estimate intrinsic value? <br/> DCF, uncertainty of future flows, importance of all factors that influecne that uncertainty. </p>

<p> When is a discount sufficient large to buy, and when should you sell? </p>

<p> Why would such a discount exist?  Why would your analysis be more correct than the market consensus? </p>

<h2> A strong stomach </h2>
<p> The difficulty of being contrarion and correct, and holding out long enough to be proven correct. </p>

<h2> Patience and a long-term view </h2>
<p> The quality of your analysis determines if you'll be correct, but not when. </p>

<p> In a market that's preoccupied with short term results, taking a long-term view uncovers mispricings. </p>
