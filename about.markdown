Hi, I'm JC. 

I enjoy making things, reading, writing, learning and moving.

This is where I organise all those things.

I'm Data Scientist at [iwoca][iwoca-url], where we're working on funding 1 Million small businesses, supporting the 
UK and German economies where it matters most.  

If you have any questions or feedback on anything on the site, please get in touch. 

Thanks for visiting!
