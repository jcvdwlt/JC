Hi, I'm JC. 

I enjoy making things, reading, writing, learning and moving.

This is where I organise some of those things.

I spend most of my time working on data problems, mainly in fintech and agtech.

At the moment I'm leading an analytics team at [Wise][wise=url], where we're builing money without borders. Before that I worked at award winning small-business lender [iwoca][iwoca-url], supporing the
UK and German economies where it matters most.  

I ocassionally consult on data or optimisation projects.  Notable clients include the largest vegatable producer in the Southern Hemishere, and notable achievements include reducing a fintech's annual losses by circa Â£1M within two weeks.  

If you have any questions or feedback on anything on the site, please get in touch. 

Thanks for visiting!
